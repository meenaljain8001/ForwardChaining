# Forward Chaining
In this project, forward chaining rules are used using a durable rule engine in python.

## Code Files
Python File - ForwardChaining.ipynb

## Install
You need to install jupyter notebook to run the ipynb file or you can also use Google Colaboratory to run the file.


## Run
To run this program you need to open jupyter notebook 
- Run the cells and answer questions as per your choice.

### Working of the project

In this project, I am applying forward chaining rules using a durable rule engine in python.
I have 4 ruleset in my program: <br/>
a) course
b) grades
c) theroy_proj
d) clubs <br />
First triggering course fact with attributes: course_int, grades and t_p.
Then based on the user's choice course will further trigger ‘grades’ fact, ‘theory_proj’ fact and
‘clubs’ fact and use Forward chaining concept.
Steps:
1. Ask for user’s grade in BTech
2. Ask for user’s course interest
3. Ask for user’s practical or theoretical interest
4. Ask for user’s other interest for extra curricular activities
5. Showing Suggestion as per user’s choice using forward chaining rules

This project was a part of my assignment in Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Delhi during my MTech 1st year.
